# Pandas Mastery — AI/ML Learning Journey 🐼📊

Welcome to the **Pandas** section of my **AI/ML Learning Journey**, where I'm mastering the most powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis — from absolute basics to advanced concepts.

---

## 📌 What is Pandas?

**Pandas** is a fast, powerful, flexible, and easy-to-use open-source data analysis and data manipulation library built on top of NumPy. It is essential for:

- Data cleaning
- Data transformation
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Time-series analysis
- Preparing data for machine learning models

## ✅ Goals of This Folder

- Understand how to work with Series and DataFrames
- Load, clean, filter, and manipulate real-world datasets
- Prepare datasets for machine learning workflows
- Build expert-level data handling skills
