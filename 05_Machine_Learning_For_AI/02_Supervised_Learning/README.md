# Supervised Learning

## What is Supervised Learning?

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm learns from labeled training data. The term "supervised" comes from the idea that the learning process is guided by the correct answers (labels) provided with the input data.

In supervised learning, the algorithm receives input data (features) along with the correct output (labels), and the goal is to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs. Once trained, the model can predict the output for new, unseen inputs.

## Types of Supervised Learning Tasks

1. **Classification** – Predict a discrete label (category).
   - Example: Email spam detection (spam or not spam).
2. **Regression** – Predict a continuous value.
   - Example: Predicting house prices based on features like area, number of rooms, etc.

## Important Supervised Learning Algorithms

### 1. Linear Regression
- **Type**: Regression
- **Use Case**: Predicting numerical values.
- **Idea**: Fits a straight line to the data points to model the relationship between features and target.

### 2. Logistic Regression
- **Type**: Classification
- **Use Case**: Binary or multiclass classification.
- **Idea**: Uses a logistic function to estimate probabilities and classify outcomes.

### 3. Decision Tree
- **Type**: Classification and Regression
- **Use Case**: Problems with both categorical and numerical features.
- **Idea**: Splits the data into subsets using decision rules based on feature values.

### 4. Random Forest
- **Type**: Classification and Regression
- **Use Case**: Handling high-dimensional data and reducing overfitting.
- **Idea**: An ensemble of decision trees that improves accuracy and stability.

### 5. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- **Type**: Classification and Regression
- **Use Case**: Complex, high-dimensional spaces.
- **Idea**: Finds the optimal hyperplane that separates data classes with the maximum margin.

### 6. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Type**: Classification and Regression
- **Use Case**: Small datasets with clear boundaries.
- **Idea**: Classifies a data point based on the majority label of its 'k' nearest neighbors.

### 7. Naive Bayes
- **Type**: Classification
- **Use Case**: Text classification, spam detection.
- **Idea**: Based on Bayes’ Theorem assuming independence between features.

### 8. Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
- **Type**: Classification and Regression
- **Use Case**: High-performance models in competitions.
- **Idea**: Builds an ensemble of weak learners in a sequential manner to reduce errors.

## When to Use Supervised Learning?

- You have labeled data.
- The task involves prediction of outputs from inputs.
- You need models that can generalize well to unseen data.
