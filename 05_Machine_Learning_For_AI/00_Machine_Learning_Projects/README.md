# 🤖 Internship Projects on Machine Learning & Deep Learning

Welcome to my internship project repository! 🎓  
This repository contains two hands-on projects focused on **Machine Learning** and **Deep Learning** techniques, developed as part of my internship to gain real-world experience in data analysis, time series forecasting, and large language model fine-tuning.

## 📌 Project 1: Ethereum (ETH/USDT) Price Forecasting using ARIMA

A complete **Time Series Analysis** project to forecast cryptocurrency prices using the ARIMA model.

### Key Highlights:
- Dataset: ETH/USDT daily price data from Kaggle.
- Techniques: Data preprocessing, EDA, ADF test, ACF/PACF plots.
- Model: ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average).
- Evaluation: RMSE, MAPE, R² score.
- Output: 30-day price forecast with visualization.

## 📌 Project 2: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning of LLaMA 3.2 on Medical Chain-of-Thought Dataset

A **Deep Learning** project that fine-tunes the **LLaMA 3.2 (3B)** model using a Medical Chain-of-Thought dataset with **parameter-efficient tuning (LoRA)** in **Unsloth**.

### Key Highlights:
- Platform: Kaggle Notebooks with GPU.
- Dataset: Medical Chain-of-Thought from Hugging Face.
- Model: LLaMA 3.2 (3B) with 4-bit quantization.
- Fine-tuning Method: LoRA via Unsloth.
- Tracking: wandb for training metrics.
- Evaluation: ROUGE-L score before and after fine-tuning.
- Output: Fine-tuned model adapter uploaded to Hugging Face.
