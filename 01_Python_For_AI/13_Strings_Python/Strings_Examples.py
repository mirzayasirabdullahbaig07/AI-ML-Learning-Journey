# What is Strings? Strings are sequence of characters
# In Python strings are sequence of unicode characters - Like Yasir - Y, A, S, I, R - These are characters 
# Characters are converted in unicode then unicode is converted in binary and machine only understand the binary(0, 1)

# 01 Creating String - How we create strings in Python?
a = 'Mirza Yasir Abdullah Baig' # Single inverted commas
print(a)
b = "Mirza Yasir Abdullah Baig" # Double Inverted Commas
print(b)
# Why the concepts of '' and "" commas
c = "it's raining outside" # here we use this kind of strings
print(c)
d = """yasir is an Ai developer and a machine learning expert"""
print(d)
e = '''this kind of strings are used when we write multiple lines and paragraphs best example is blogs'''
print(e)
