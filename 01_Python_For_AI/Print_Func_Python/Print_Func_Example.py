#What is print: print is the built-in-function, we use that print function to print anything

#Example No:1
print("Mirza Yasir Abdullah Baig")

# You can print any type of datatype
print(107) #integer
print(False) #Boolean
print(0.1) #float
print(2 + 3j) #complex number

# You can print many different things in one time
print("India", "Pakistan", "Nepal")

# You can also print different datatypes in one time
print("Mirza Yasir Abdullah Baig", 24, 3.12, True)

#sep parameter: separator
print("Mirza", "Yasir", "Abdullah", "Baig", sep = '/')

#End parameter
print("Mirza", "Yasir", "Abdullah", end= ' ')
print("Baig")

#That's it, this is all about the print function
#Print function is very commonly used function in python, you can use it sub-conciously in your programs
