# 🚀 AI/ML Learning Journey

Hello and welcome to my **AI/ML Learning Journey**! 👋  
This space is more than just a repository — it's my **digital notebook**, **learning log**, and a growing **showcase** of everything I’m exploring on my path to becoming a **Machine Learning Engineer**.

---

## 🧠 Why I Started This Journey

After completing my **Computer Science degree**, I discovered a deep passion for **Artificial Intelligence**, **Machine Learning**, and the ways intelligent systems are reshaping our world.

From building foundational models to experimenting with **Generative AI**, and diving into **MLOps**, this journey represents my personal commitment to **lifelong learning** and **hands-on experimentation**.

---

## 🎯 The Goal

The **core mission** of this journey is simple but powerful:

> 🌟 *To become an expert in AI/ML by continuously learning, applying, and sharing real-world, intelligent solutions using Python and modern machine learning techniques.*

I believe true mastery comes from **doing**, not just reading. This repository will evolve with me — reflecting what I learn, build, break, and improve over time.

---

## ✨ What’s Coming Up

Here’s the roadmap I’m following:

1. **Revisit Python basics** to ensure a rock-solid foundation.
2. **Master Machine Learning fundamentals** — supervised, unsupervised, and ensemble methods.
3. Explore **Deep Learning** with frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch.
4. Dive into **Generative AI** and experiment with tools like GPT, DALL·E, and more.
5. Learn about **MLOps**, deployment pipelines, and productionizing models.

This is only the beginning. I’ll be **updating this repository regularly** with code, notes, projects, and reflections as I grow.
