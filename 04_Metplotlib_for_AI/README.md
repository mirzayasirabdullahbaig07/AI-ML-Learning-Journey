## ✅ Topics Covered in Matplotlib

### 1. 📈 Basic Plots
- Line Plot
- Bar Plot
- Scatter Plot
- Pie Chart
- Histogram

### 2. 🛠 Plot Customization
- Titles, labels, legends
- Colors, line styles, markers
- Gridlines and axes control
- Adding text and annotations

### 3. 🧩 Subplots and Figures
- Creating multiple plots in one figure
- `plt.subplot()` and `plt.subplots()`
- Controlling figure size and layout

### 4. 📊 Working with Data
- Plotting data from Pandas DataFrames
- Plotting NumPy arrays
- Using loops and conditions to create dynamic plots

### 5. 🎨 Styling and Themes
- Using different styles (e.g., `ggplot`, `seaborn`)
- Customizing plot appearance globally

### 6. 💾 Saving Figures
- Save plots as images (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.pdf`, etc.)
- Adjust resolution using `dpi` parameter
